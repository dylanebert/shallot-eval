// Pure derivation of a graded task's result kind from its three determined inputs — typecheck ok,
// build ok, gate ok. No side effects or browser-driver imports: `grade.ts` is a top-level script
// (argv parsing, top-level await) that can never be imported by an arm, so this sibling module is
// what a test imports and calls directly instead of reading `grade.ts`'s source as an AST.
//
// INCOMPLETE is reserved for a run where NOTHING determined the outcome — the browser gate never ran
// (no browser/GPU/preview premise, a staging failure, no result) and typecheck/build both held. A determined typecheck
// or build failure outranks an unrunnable gate: it is a legitimate FAIL even when the gate never ran,
// never laundered into "could not measure" about a task this run did measure and fail.
